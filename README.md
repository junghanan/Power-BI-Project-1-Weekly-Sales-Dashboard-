# Weekly Sales Dashboard Project

**A Purpose of the Project** 
 
The project was initiated since there was no dashboard that combined all 4 types of sales due to its complexity of aligning the fiscal and promo calendar.

**Dashboard Tool** 

Tool:PowerBI

**Project Workflows**
1. Wrote all SQLs. The SQL involved 7 different tables and involved aligning the fiscal calendar and promo calendar. 
    
    a. **Reg Sales (SQL)** - Aligned Reg Sales Fiscal Calendar data to Promo Calander before combining.
    
    b. **Combination of Reg & Promo Sales (SQL)** - Combined Promo data with Reg Sales.  
    
2. Worked with end-users to ensure that all required information was added to the dashboard
3. Linked Weekly Sales Dashboard Main Data to Power BI (the main data is loaded on Github). 
4. Created Power BI Dashboard using Dax equations. 
5. Led all walkthroughs with Vice President, Associate Vice Presidents, managers, individual contributors. 
6. Maintained the dashboard and made additional features to improve the dashboard experiences. 

**Note**

Due to confidential information, I could not show the actual file of the dashboard. Please refer to a screenshot of how it looks like.
