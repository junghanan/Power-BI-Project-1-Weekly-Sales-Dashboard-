**Weekly Sales Dashboard Project**

This project was led by me during my tenure at Canadian Tire Corporation as Associate Manager, Customer Promo Reporting. 


**Why this was initiated:** 
 
The project was initiated because there was no dashboard that combined all 4 types of sales due to difficulties aligning the fiscal and promo calendars.
Even though stakeholders wanted to see correlations between the four types of sales, it was impossible since three types used the fiscal calendar and promo sales used the promo calendar. 


**Dashboard Tool:** Power BI 
This was a first dashboard that was built on Power BI for Promotion Division.  


**What did I do:**
1. Wrote all SQL statements. The statement involved 7 different tables. 
2. Worked with end-users to ensure that all required information was added to the dashboard
2. Linked Weekly Sales Dashboard Main Data to Power BI. 
3. Created Power BI Dashboard using Dax equations. 
4. Led all walkthroughs with Vice President, Associate Vice Presidents, managers, individual contributors. 
5. Maintained the dashboard and made additional features to improve the dashboard experiences.
